# Prototype-for-Edtech
 Prototype creation for the Edtech Platform for improving groupproject collaboration
Universities and K12 learning institutions are increasingly adopting digital platforms. When students are required to work on collaborative projects and activities, EdTech platforms and portals used by universities fail to facilitate effective collaborative tools, let alone make them accessible and user friendly. Students often resort to using third party tools, which may increase inconvenience and could potentially risk data security.

With a significant gap in the area of collaborative tools on academic platforms, addressing this deficiency for the effective communication and teamwork among students is of paramount importance. The enhancement shall focus on the following areas -

Accessible Communication Features such as Real-time Messaging: 
Incorporate real-time messaging with flexible options for text, audio, and video communication that work seamlessly with assistive technologies, ensuring accessibility.
Integrate various tools such as whiteboards and kanbans into the communication platform to expose students to industry-standard tools used in real-world professional environments and bridge the gap between academic learning and the practical skills.

Customizable & Meaningful Collaboration Spaces
Develop collaboration spaces that cater to diverse learning needs for both individual work and group collaboration within the same platform.

Inclusive Participation Mechanisms: 
Allow users to communicate through different media (eg: video/text) and allow anonymity to ensure everyone is allowed to express themselves safely. 
A variety of media and materials for communication, including visual, art, music, social media, etc., not only introduces learners to composition, but also removes media-specific barriers, increasing accessibility.

Reliable Guidance and Feedback Support: 
Provide appropriate resources and guides that are available to all times to ensure a smooth learning curve for adapting to these collaborative tools.
